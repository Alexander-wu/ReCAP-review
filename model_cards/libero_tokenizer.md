# libero_tokenizer

Dataset-specific tokenizer for ReCAP visual open-loop experiments.

- Training: 20,000 tokenizer steps + 20,000 world-model steps. LIBERO-90, 81/9 task split.
- Initialization: thuml/rt1-compressive-tokenizer (codec) and thuml/rt1-world-model-multi-step-rlvr (world model).
- Format: diffusers; full strict-load weights, no optimizer/RNG state in inference release.
- Pair only with `libero_tokenizer`, `libero_world`, and `libero_action_ranges` from the same manifest.
- Weights: separate dependency; see the anonymous snapshot access note in the repository README.
- License: MIT, retaining the starting model terms and attribution. This card does not grant rights over the training dataset. The Apache-2.0 code license is separate from checkpoint licensing.
- Intended use: research video prediction with supplied actions. Not validated as a deployed robot controller.
- Metrics: see artifacts/results; selected GIFs are not representative aggregate estimates.
- Integrity: exact per-file SHA-256 and byte counts are in weights_manifest.json.

ReCAP is training-free context scheduling and has no additional model parameters.
